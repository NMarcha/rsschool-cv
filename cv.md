About Me
Hello, my name is Nina Marchenko and Iâ€™m Frontend Developer based in Krakow, dedicated to bringing digital designs to life through clean and efficient code. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I thrive on transforming static mockups into dynamic and interactive web applications. My passion for coding is fueled by the constant evolution of web technologies, and I am committed to staying on the cutting edge. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, turning design concepts into functional, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. Eager to tackle challenges, I am excited about contributing to projects that push the boundaries of innovation and enhance the overall user experience.
